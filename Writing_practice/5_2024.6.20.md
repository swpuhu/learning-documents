I've already writing 5 article, but I haven't yet introduced myself, so I decided to introduce myself. 

Firstly, my name is Hans Hu. you can call me Hans. I am currently working at a education company as  a software engineer. My major responsibilities involve developing game for courseware and maintain some old project, such as a certain project that provide a platform for teacher to teach online. Speaking of my career path, actually, I was not in the industry at first. My major is Mechanical Engineer, so I was engaged in mechanical industry after graduting. I can barely make a living throughout this period of as a mechanical engineer, so I resolve to transfer to Internet industry and started to learn Front-End developing technique.

After 4 moths, I found a work as Front-End engineer, and I was satisfied with the salary they paid for me. At this moment, I accomplished my goal that I had  always wanted to change industry. At this company, I had working hard and been dying to learn new techniques. The most impressive thing is that I learned WebGL and improve the performance of application beyond 100%. I am so prode of this, and this technique still brought me a lot of benefits until now. I really appreciated myself can keep learning.
