# Writing Practice 4

The 4th practice **session** has been ~~pasting~~ **delayed by** 4 days from the last, because the work recently has been much buysier. I have to finish my work firstly. 

Speaking of work, I encounter some difficult problem. Let me describe this problem. it is about transform problem of graphics.

⁄Given a arbitrary graphics has already rotated and scaled, now it is needed to be scaled again. The question is, after scaling again,    how much the object's state (rotate and scale) is. Firstly, I thought it was a simple question, I use a iteration method to solve it, but it was difference once it required showing a transition process. I need figure out how this transition happen and calculate right scale and rotation degree. That's it. But now, I don't want to think about the problem anymore, because I ⁄⁄feel exhausted, and I need to have a rest.



OK, Let's talk about something else. I want to share you a kind of tea. It is called "XiaoShenNongJia" wild Tea. Literally, the tea was growing at wild environment. "XiaoShenNongJia" is a nature reserve located at "HuBei" Province. At this moment, I've drunk the tea. It has really unique smell and taste, I feel like I'm being in nature surrounding by bamboo and fragrant flowers.



Next, I will continue my work. I still have a lot of work to do. Not only regularly work such as game development or making template, but also some classroom software development has to finish. I have to struggle to finish it. OK, That's all for today. It's time to get off work!





## GPT:

The fourth practice session has been delayed by four days due to an increasingly busy work schedule. I had to prioritize finishing my tasks first.

Speaking of work, I've encountered **a challenging problem**. Let me describe it: **it involves** a transformation issue with graphics.

Given an arbitrary graphic that has already been rotated and scaled, it now needs to be scaled again. The question is, after this second scaling, what will be the new state of the object in terms of rotation and scale? **Initially**, I thought this was a simple problem. I used an iterative method to solve it, but it became complicated when **I had to demonstrate** the transition process. I need to figure out how this transition occurs and calculate the correct scale and rotation degree. That's it. However, I'm feeling exhausted now and need to take a break from thinking about it.

OK, let's talk about something else. I want to share **a type of tea** with you. It's called "XiaoShenNongJia" wild tea. **As the name suggests**, this tea grows in the wild. "XiaoShenNongJia" is a nature reserve located in Hubei Province. I’ve been drinking this tea, and it has a **truly unique aroma and taste**. It makes me feel like I'm surrounded by bamboo and fragrant flowers in nature.

Next, I will continue my work. I still have a lot to do, not only my regular tasks such as game development and creating templates, but also finishing some classroom software development. I have to work hard to complete everything. OK, that’s all for today. It's time to get off work!
