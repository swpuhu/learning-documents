I am a senior editor at Walker Publishing, where I **specialize in** editing poems and picture books for preschoolers and young adult

I have worked on more than seventy poems and fifty books. Tow of them have been nominated for the New York Times Best Children's Books of the Year.



I believe that books are out best friends. They create questions and answer questions. They inspire us to dream while encouraging us to realize our dreams.



Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, cooking, and freeform dancing. I'm happiest when I'm with my husband, iout beautiful daughter, and our precious two-year-old English Foxhound, Ellie.
